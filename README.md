# ImageEditing
Two pieces of software are included in this directory. The first, ImgGUI, is a very rudimentary image editor in Javascript. The second, ColourGUI, is a colour space converter which converts colour values between colour spaces. The primary purpose of writing the software was practicing Computer Graphics concepts and Javascript.

To use the Image Editor, run "ImgGUI" from within the build directory.

To use the Colour Space converter, run "ColourGUI" from within the build directory.

This software was written by E.J. Khouri in 2016.
